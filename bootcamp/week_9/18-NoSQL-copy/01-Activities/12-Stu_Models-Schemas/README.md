# üìê Add Comments to Implementation of Models and Schemas Using Mongoose

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the code found in [models/Book.js](./Unsolved/models/Book.js) and [server.js](./Unsolved/server.js).

## üìù Notes

Ensure that the `mongoose` package is using version 6+. The latest version of `mongoose` (version 7+) introduces potential breaking changes to activities. All activities have version `6.9.2` in their respective `package.json` files, but should you install `mongoose`, please use `npm i mongoose@6.9.2`.

Refer to the documentation:

[Mongoose docs on models](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html)

[Mongoose docs on schemas](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)

[Mongoose docs on validation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html)

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you design a custom validator using a validation function to suit your data's needs?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
