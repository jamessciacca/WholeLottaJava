module.exports = sum

// to run jest, in the terminal I have to enter -
//npm init -y (to initiate the npm, which is a library of code packages)
//-- when this is run we see package.json appear in the workspace
//next install jest by entering npm i jest 
//--we see node.modules which are the building blocks of jest
//--we also see package-lock.json which is the object notation of the jest application
//next go into the package.json folder and find the tests object and change its value to jest!
//-- now when we run npm test it will run the jest application!
//next you need to create a test file, this is the same name as your js file with .test added to it (sum.test.js)

//instructions continue in the sum.text.js file!
