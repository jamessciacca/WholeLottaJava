        Hello everyone, my name is James Sciacca! I am currently a Computer Science Student at NJIT and am taking a gap semester to participate in this bootcamp course. I chose to take this course to get ahead with programming and to improve my portfolio for opportunities in the future. I look forward to meeting and working with everyone.
        A fun fact about me is that I love working out, it's a nice way to relieve stress and move around especially after sitting at a desk all day.
        Good luck to everyone!
      </p>
